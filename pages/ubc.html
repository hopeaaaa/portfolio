      <p class="final-design__body">
        The UBC Pharmacists Clinic is a university-affiliated, pharmacist-led
        patient care clinic. At the clinic, the clinicians use their specialized
        knowledge in medication to support the care of medically complex
        patients. <br />
        <br />
        As Healthcare Service Designer for the clinic, I worked to improve the clinical
        processes and patient experience by integrating new technologies and
        streamlining digital interactions. I led the service and UX design
        processes, collaborating closely with clinicians, administrators, developers, and
        external stakeholders to deliver solutions. My contributions spanned
        research, design, implementation, and mentorship, resulting in a more
        efficient and user-friendly experience for patients and staff alike. Below is a snapshot of a few projects I
        worked on.
