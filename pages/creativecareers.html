                    <p class="impact__body">Designed and launched a centralized digital platform that streamlined access
                      to career and work-integrated learning resources, supporting over 1,800 students, alumni, and
                      prospective applicants annually. <br> <br>
                      Extended the reach of the Career Development Office by transforming formerly in-person services
                      into a 24/7 accessible digital resource, increasing off-campus and asynchronous access. <br><br>
                      Improved capacity of the Career Development Office and student autonomy by designing an intuitive,
                      self-serve portal that addressed common student challenges and FAQs.
                      <br><br>
                      Created a digital advising toolkit staff now reference during appointments, improving advising
                      efficiency and consistency.
                      <br><br>
                      Consolidated 30+ fragmented resources into one user-friendly hub, reducing friction in the
                      advising process and empowering users to find support independently.
                      <br><br>
                      Integrated into curriculum; the platform was adopted by faculty teaching Professional Practice,
                      the university’s mandatory career development course for students, and has been shared with
                      faculty at other institutions.
