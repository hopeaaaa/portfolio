            I took the lead on the design of this tool because the students team struggled with the scope of the
            challenge. In our research (and my experience as an educator) students ask the career advisors ‘what should
            I do after I graduate?’ The primary challenge for this tool was how to address this question without being
            redundant (photography major = photographer, illustration major = illustrator, etc.) or vague (’you can do
            so many things with your degree!’) The secondary challenge involved how we would present the many career
            options and their interconnectedness.

            We began by locating all the career resources on campus. We contacted faculty, researched careers, including
            pausing films during the credits to write down the different positions. In my role as Design Lead/Co op
            Supervisor, I conducted a precedent study of career websites and prepared resources for students, including
            university brand guidelines and concept sketches from meetings with the Career Development Office. Since the
            bulk of this project took place during the lockdown and heatwave, I lead remote user testing with alumni.

            Students are guided through three questions: What am I passionate or curious about? What are my skills or
            interests? What are my workplace values?
            <br>
            They respond by dragging answers into a central circle. Once all three questions are completed, a
            downloadable
            PDF is generated with their selections and a worksheet for further reflection.
            <br>
            Alternatively, students can explore industry-specific resources or a participatory infographic that includes
            local resources and an answer key mapping career titles to each degree major.

            Since launch, the Creative Careers site has continued to evolve. While the current design reflects updated
            university branding, the core functionality, layout, and structure remain true to our original goals of
            making
            career resources more accessible, student-centered, and actionable. This progression reflects one of my
            biggest takeaways from the project: good design should adapt, scale, and serve the needs of its community
            over
            time.
