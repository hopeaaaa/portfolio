      The UBC Pharmacists Clinic is a university-affiliated, pharmacist-led
      patient care clinic. At the Clinic, the clinicians use their specialized
      knowledge in medication to support the care of medically complex
      patients. <br />
      <br />
      As Healthcare Service Designer for the clinic, I worked to improve the clinical
      processes and patient experience by integrating new technologies and
      streamlining digital interactions. I led the service and UX design
      processes, collaborating closely with clinicians, administrators, and
      external stakeholders to deliver solutions. My contributions spanned
      research, design, implementation, and mentorship, resulting in a more
      efficient and user-friendly experience for patients and staff alike. Below is a snapshot of a few projects I
      worked on.

            <p class="accordion__body">The clinic requires EMR UI improvements because OSCAR was
              designed to primarily meet the needs of physicians, whose workflow needs differ from pharmacists.
              Pharmacists/clinicians are
              experts
              in how medications work for people, including their dosages, side effects, and interactions with
              other medications. Identifying, resolving, and preventing drug therapy problems (DTPs) are the distinctive
              contributions of
              clinicians. A DTP is any undesirable event experienced by a patient that involves or is suspected to
              involve
              drug therapy. These problems can manifest in a variety of forms and develop when the use or
              non-use of certain medications result in the less-than-optimal clinical outcomes for a patient.
              Several factors contribute to the development of a DTP, making it a complex issue within the
